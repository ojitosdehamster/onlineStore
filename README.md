## Online Store Project Tasks

1. **Add More Products:** Expand the list of available products in the store. This involves creating new instances of the `Product` class and displaying them in the user interface.

2. **Enhance User Interface:** Style and design the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to improve the layout and usability.

3. **Remove Products from Cart:** Implement functionality that allows users to remove individual products from their shopping cart.

4. **Manage Product Quantities:** Allow users to adjust product quantities in their cart, e.g., increase or decrease the quantity of a product before making a purchase.

5. **Implement User Authentication:** If necessary, develop a user authentication system. This will enable users to have individual accounts and track their orders.

6. **Data Persistence:** Consider how product, cart, and order data will be saved and retrieved. You can use browser local storage or explore server and database options if building a more complex application.

7. **Process Purchase Orders:** Implement functionality to process purchase orders, including calculating the total, generating order confirmations, and, if needed, interacting with payment systems.

8. **Manage Order History:** If relevant, build functionality for users to view their history of previous orders.

9. **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement proper error handling and validation to ensure that users cannot perform incorrect or unexpected actions.

10. **Optimization and Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure the application functions correctly on different browsers and devices. Identify and address performance issues if necessary.

11. **Documentation:** Write clear and concise documentation for the source code and application functionality. This will aid in maintenance and future enhancements.

12. **Deployment:** Prepare the application for deployment to a live server if necessary. This may involve setting up a web server and database, securing the application, and other deployment-related steps.

13. **Ongoing Support:** Once the application is in production, provide ongoing support to resolve issues, perform updates, and add new features as needed.

Please note that the project's scope and complexity may vary, so it's important to plan and prioritize tasks based on the specific goals of your online store. Additionally, consider scalability and security as your project grows.
